= Unnamed Card Game =

== Game Idea ==
* Two players face off in a card game/duel.
* There are three categories of cards: Energy, Nature, and Spirit.
    - Energy cards' focus is on being powerful.
    - Nature cards' focus is on refinement.
    - Spirit cards' focus is on strategy.
* Players' "field" is a 3x3 grid
    - Most monsters attack down a single lane
    - If a lane is empty, the player is attacked directly.
* Starter cards:
    - Golem: Energy.  Defensive monster with high hitpoints.
    - Peasant: Nature.  Weak monster that can be equipped/upgraded into a Knight.
    - Imp: Spirit.  Weak creature that moves left/right when attacked to avoid death.
